Responsive File Manager running on .NET Core with Peachpie

Getting Started

Get the NuGet package from: https://www.nuget.org/packages/ResponsiveFileManager/

And for a demo project, you can use the source code in this repo, as follows:

1. Run `dotnet restore`

2. Right-click the `Website` project and choose **Reload Project**

3. Set the WebApplication project as the default, if it isn't already.

4. Run and test one of the 3 demo pages

5. Look at the `Startup.cs` file for configuration to copy to your own project to use with the NuGet package.

**NOTE**: This is a work in progress. At this time, the project is functional, but there are some minor bugs. Further details can be found here: [Peachpie Issue 185](https://github.com/peachpiecompiler/peachpie/issues/185)
